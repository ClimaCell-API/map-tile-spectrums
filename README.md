#### Spectrums and Legends for ClimaCell API ####
We're big believer in the "dogfooding" approach and use our API for our other product lines. The legends and spectrums are taken directly from the Hypercast platform.

### What's Includes ###
Our full collection of detailed spectrums (legends) and plain spectrums, including the Spectrum Maker and spectrums scheme - allowing you to generate your own in any resolution needed.
